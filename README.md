Stuff for OSCP

Most of the stuff in this repo is meant for temporary use. It's coded poorly, but gets the job done...


I see you people starting to star and fork this... A warning for you: Abandon all hope, ye who enter here...

I am currently working on a major overhaul of this Repo, as well as augmenting it with my GitHub Pages site. Please pardon my mess.
